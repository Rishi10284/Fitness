This project aims to develop an AI-powered fitness tracking system that accurately estimates calorie expenditure using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing user activity data, the system identifies the best-performing model through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and performance evaluation. A Flask-based web application is integrated, allowing users to input activity details and receive real-time calorie predictions.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ” Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, XGBoost
âœ” Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC
âœ” Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Flask
âœ” Application: Personalized fitness tracking for better health monitoring

This project bridges the gap in traditional calorie estimation methods by leveraging AI for higher accuracy and personalized insights. ðŸš€
